# xpath_technical

Incomplete.

Intended goal is to take xml input and generate checksum. This is done by taking the five elements above and below a specific element (prodSpecialPrice) and stripping them of all information that does not pertain to that element. The specific element is located via xpath.

Got stuck on CORS error while trying to input local sample as xml.
